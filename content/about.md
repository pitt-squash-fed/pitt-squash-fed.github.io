	WHO ARE WE?
	</h1>
</center>

<center>

We are a group of University of Pittsburgh squash players. The group has been playing regularly since 1996, and managed by "the chief" of the group, [**David Brumble**](https://www.english.pitt.edu/h-david-brumble).

[**James Conway**](https://www.structbio.pitt.edu/index.php/12-faculty/18-james-conway) of the federation has said to the [**University Times**](https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/): “We’re (a) very international, enthusiastic and diverse group of around 40 who meet three to four times a week to engage in several hours of healthy squash activity while also fostering social and academic exchange within a wide cross-section of the Pitt community.” This was part of the article [**"Squash ‘federation’ brings together diverse group from across Pitt"**](https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/news/squash-federation-brings)
