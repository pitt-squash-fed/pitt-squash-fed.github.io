We are a group of squash players who are located in Pittsburgh, PA. We meet regularly to play squash at the University of Pittsburgh campus. The group was founded in 1996 by the cheif of the group [**David Brumble**](https://www.english.pitt.edu/h-david-brumble).

[**James Conway**](https://www.structbio.pitt.edu/index.php/12-faculty/18-james-conway) of the federation has said to the [**University Times**](https://www.utimes.pitt.edu/):

“We’re (a) very international, enthusiastic and diverse group of around 40 who meet three to four times a week to engage in several hours of healthy squash activity while also fostering social and academic exchange within a wide cross-section of the Pitt community.”
